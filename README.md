# qunt

## Summary

QUNT (pronounced "kyÅ«nt", not...the other way) is an esoteric programming language influenced by Brainfuck.  It features 26 different commands, uses a "queue" metaphor for data manipulation, and has very terse syntax.  It features 26 different commands, uses a "queue" metaphor for data manipulation, and has very terse syntax.  For example, here's a Fibonacci sequence generator written in QUNT.  It will generate and display the first 10 iterations of the sequence:

    >0&?>1&?+?:{7<+?:}

## The QUNT Compiler/Interpreter

The official QUNT Compiler/Interpreter, qunt.pl, is written in Perl, and requires a default installation of Perl to run it and the compiled code produced by it. If called without any arguments, qunt.pl enters shell mode, where you can enter QUNT commands or statements and have them immediately executed.

The shell is the easiest way to write, debug, and test QUNT code. Tools are provided to execute code, view code that has been previously written, and write entered code to file.

	localhost:~ user$ qunt.pl
	 _____ _____ _____ _____
	|     |  |  |   | |_   _|
	|  |  |  |  | | | | | |  
	|__  _|_____|_|___| |_|
	   |__|            v0.053

	QUNT Interactive Shell
	Enter QUNT commands to be executed, or "dump" to show entered code
	To write entered code to file, pass a filename as an argument to "dump"
	Use the command "clear" to delete entered code from memory
	.

If qunt.pl is executed with the word "debug" as the only argument, it will still enter shell mode, only it will display the Perl code generated by each QUNT command/statement, as well as executing the compiled code.  For example, given the QUNT statement >1>1+? (which adds 1 and 1 together, and prints the result), this would be displayed in the shell:

	. >1>1+?
	*     push(@QUEUE,1);
	*     push(@QUEUE,1);
	*     $BUFFER = 0;
	*     foreach my $e (@QUEUE){
	*     $BUFFER += $e; * }
	*     if($BUFFER){}else{ $BUFFER = 0; }
	*     print $BUFFER."\n";

If a valid filename is passed as an argument to qunt.pl, the QUNT code contained in that file is compiled to Perl, and the resulting code is printed to STDOUT.  If the code in the last example were saved to a file named oneandone.q, you could compile it with:

	localhost:~ user$ qunt.pl oneandone.q
	#  _____ _____ _____ _____
	# |     |  |  |   | |_   _|
	# |  |  |  |  | | | | | |  
	# |__  _|_____|_|___| |_|
	#    |__|
	# QUNT Compiler v0.053
	# This program is the output of a compiler; please don't edit it

	use strict;
	use warnings;

	my @QUEUE = (); my @WORK_QUEUE_COPY = (); my $BUFFER = 0;

	sub qunt_is_number {
		my $n = shift;

		if ($n=~/^\d+$/) { return 1; }
		if ($n=~/^-?\d+$/) { return 1; }
		if ($n=~/^[+-]?\d+$/) { return 1; }
		if ($n=~/^-?\d+\.?\d*$/) { return 1; }
		if ($n=~/^-?(?:\d+(?:\.\d*)?|\.\d+)$/) { return 1; }
		if ($n=~/\D/) { return undef; } return undef;
	}
	push(@QUEUE,1);
	push(@QUEUE,1);
	$BUFFER = 0;
	foreach my $e (@QUEUE){
		$BUFFER += $e;
	}
	if($BUFFER){}else{ $BUFFER = 0; }
	print $BUFFER."\n";

	localhost:~ user$

A QUNT program can also be directly interpreted, without having to pipe it to Perl, by using the "run" argument to qunt.pl.  Execute qunt.pl with the word "run" as the first argument, and the filename of the program you want to interpret as the second.  If you're having trouble remembering all these command-line options, you can execute qunt.pl with the world "help" as the only argument to display usage information.

Piping code to qunt.pl is possible.  Any code piped to qunt.pl is immediately interpreted, rather than compiled to source.

## The Queue

QUNT is based around the "queue":  a sequence of numbers, of variable length, that is manipulated and operated upon.  Besides the queue, QUNT features a "buffer";  the results of mathematical operations is stored in the buffer, buffer values can be added to the queue, and queue values can be stored in the buffer.   Initially, the buffer is set to zero.  This is the core concept of QUNT.  The only command that does not operate on either the queue or the buffer is the $ command, which is used to display text (see Displaying Text, below).

Think of the queue as a list of numbers.  You can print these numbers, or perform mathematical operations on them.  Math works differently in QUNT than in other programming languages.  All math operations are performed on the entire queue, rather than on one or two values at a time.  For example, addition is fairly normal.  Given a queue with the values [1,2,3], if we perform the addition operation (with the + command), the result "6" will be stored in the buffer;  that is, "1+2+3 = 6". Things get a little stranger when we use other mathematical operations.  Given a queue with the values [3,2,3], if we were to perform the exponential operation (with the ^ command), the result "729" will be stored in the buffer.  That's because "(32)3 = 729".  Each operation is performed on every value in the queue, in sequence.

Let's try another example, this time with the subtraction command, -.  Given a queue with the values [10,5,3,2], if we issue the - command, we end up with the result "0" in the buffer, because "(((105)-3)-2) = 0".

The division command, /, works like the others.  Given a queue with the values [10,5,1], if we issue the / command, we end up with "2" in the buffer, because "((10/5)/1) = 2".
