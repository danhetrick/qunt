qunt
====

QUNT (pronounced "kyÅ«nt", not...the other way) is an esoteric programming language influenced by Brainfuck.  It features 26 different commands, uses a "queue" metaphor for data manipulation, and has very terse syntax.

The official QUNT Compiler/Interpreter, qunt.pl, is written in Perl, and requires a default installation of Perl to run it and the compiled code produced by it.
